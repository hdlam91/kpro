\\Comment: Several days lost to unaviodable illness and other unaviodable absence

\section{Problems and issues}
Setting up a Microsoft SQL server for viewing the database dump we got from the customer,
and for testing against later, proved to be extremely challenging. We ran into serious problems
with installation and dependencies, which were not improved by the need for three separate software
packages, which needed separate download and installation.

Before the sprint we did not anticipate the need for this set-up, because the customer said they would do
it for us. We should probably have pushed them more to do it.

We also lost some work-hours due to group illness, and subsequent catch-up in other subjects with shorter deadlines. Some work-hours were also lost to family-problems. 

\section{Planning for the following period}
Sprint 2, some brief points:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Database submission
\item Database model for interaction
\item Database retrieval
\item Databaseentry rollback support
\end{itemize}

- Sprint 2 planning, 30th sept.\\
- Sprint 2 review, 11th Oct.
