\section{Sprint 2}

\subsection{Time Frame}
The time frame for Sprint 2 was week 40 and 41. We started the sprint on September 30th with a weekly supervisor meeting, followed by a sprint plan meeting. We finished the sprint on October 11th with a sprint review meeting.

\subsection{Original Plan}
From our Work Breakdown Structure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Receiving pdf-file and save in correct folder
	\item Putting accompanying data in Webassistenten database (table “prospekt”)
	\item Checking accompanying data for required fields
	\item Placing an order in the internal order system
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Revised Plan}
At the sprint plan meeting, we planned the following for this sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Setting up a connection to the 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development}
At the end of the first sprint, we received a database dump from the customer. The majority of sprint 2 development was centered around setting up a connection to this database through Entity Framework.

Near the end of sprint 2, we realized that we had created the wrong type of project. We had missed the fact that the solution was supposed to use Web API, and had created an MVC project. Some time was therefore spent creating a new Web API project, and porting the code from the previous project into the new one.

\subsection{Other Work}
The deadline for the mid term delivery of the report was originally October 14th, but was at one point in time moved to October 8th. This date coincided with the middle of sprint 2, so a relatively big part of the sprint was spent preparing the report for this delivery. When the deadline was moved back to its original date, more time was spent on improving the report.

\subsection{Backlog}
What we planned for the sprint that we either did not complete, get time to start, or that was simply pushed back

\subsection{Retrospective}
How we feel about the sprint. What we learned, what we are satisfied with, and what we are dissatisfied with.
