\section{Sprint 2}

\subsection{Time Frame}
The time frame for Sprint 2 was week 40 and 41. We started the sprint on September 30th with a weekly supervisor meeting, followed by a sprint plan meeting. We finished the sprint on October 11th with a sprint review meeting.

\subsection{Original Plan}
From our Work Breakdown Structure, we had the following tasks planned for this sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Receiving pdf-file and save in correct folder
	\item Putting accompanying data in Webassistenten database (table “prospekt”)
	\item Checking accompanying data for required fields
	\item Placing an order in the internal order system
\end{itemize}

Additionally, the following tasks were carried from the previous sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Database connection interface
	\item Database submission logic
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Revised Plan}
At the sprint plan meeting, we planned the following for this sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Set up Entity Framework
	\item Modify start page
	\item Implement saving of pdf-files
	\item Prepare report for midterm delivery
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development}
At the end of the first sprint, we received a database dump from the customer. The majority of sprint 2 development was centered around setting up a connection to this database through Entity Framework.
We managed to set up an instance of MSSQL server and restore the database dump we got from the customer and then connected the project in Visual Studio 2012 with the database server instance. This connection to the database via EF created a model of every single table in the database, which now let us generate controllers for the tables we needed.

Near the end of sprint 2, we realized that we had created the wrong type of project. We had missed the fact that the solution was supposed to use Web API, and had created an MVC project. Some time was therefore spent creating a new Web API project, and porting the code from the previous project into the new one.

\subsection{Other Work}
The deadline for the mid term delivery of the report was originally October 14th, but was at one point in time moved to October 8th. This date coincided with the middle of sprint 2, so a relatively big part of the sprint was spent preparing the report for this delivery. When the deadline was moved back to its original date, more time was spent on improving the report.

\subsection{Backlog}
What we planned for the sprint that we either did not complete, get time to start, or that was simply pushed back.
