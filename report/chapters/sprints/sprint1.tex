\section{Sprint 1}

\subsection{Time Frame}
The time frame for Sprint 1 was week 38 and 39. We started the sprint on September 16th with a weekly supervisor meeting, followed by a sprint plan meeting. We finished the sprint on September 27th, with the sprint review meeting postponed to the following Monday.

<Perhaps a paragraph about how much time we planned on spending vs how much we actually spent?>

\subsection{Original Plan}
From our Work Breakdown Structure, we had the following tasks planned for this sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Enable display of available products (no GUI is to be implemented)
	\item Listing the next 5 available booking dates for a selected product
	\item Listing modules available for a selected product
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Revised Plan}
Being quite unfamiliar with the process, we did not revise the plan for the first sprint as we were unaware at the time that we would not be able to complete all - or even any - of the planned tasks.

\subsection{Development}
The development started off with the creation of an ASP.NET MVC project. In this project we created data objects for the ad info described in the assignment.

Towards the end of the sprint, we received a database dump from the customer, which we spent the entire rest of the sprint attempting to restore. Please refer to Appendix \ref{dbSetup} for more information on this.

\subsection{Other Work}
In addition to the development, we also completed a draft of the outline for this report and improved on our architectural documentation by adding new and removing unused views.

\subsection{Backlog}
Of the tasks planned at the beginning of the sprint, the following remained in our backlog at the end of the sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Enable display of available products (no GUI is to be implemented)
	\item Listing the next 5 available booking dates for a selected product
	\item Listing modules available for a selected product
\end{itemize}

These tasks were incidentally all the tasks we had planned for the sprint, as we were a bit optimistic in our planning. Some of these were included in the revised plan for sprint 2, while others were postponed to be included in a later sprint.

\subsection{Customer Meeting}

We also asked the customer about their opinion on this architecture.

\subsection{Retrospective}
While we had initially planned to complete some of the "easy" parts of the implementation during this sprint, this turned out to be a lot harder than expected. We only managed to get started before we ran into problems related to unfamiliarity with the technology.

We also spent less time both on development and on the project in general than we had originally planned, partly due to projects in other courses also taking up a lot of our time.

What we learned from this sprint was more about how much we would actually be able to do in a single sprint, and that we were still quite far away from being able to implement specific parts of the requirements. We started doubting that we would be able to finish in three sprints, but remained hopeful. We also learned a lot about the tools we used.
