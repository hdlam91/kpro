\section{Sprint 1}

\subsection{Time Frame}
The time frame for Sprint 1 was week 38 and 39. We started the sprint on September 16th with a weekly supervisor meeting, followed by a sprint plan meeting. We finished the sprint on September 27th with a sprint review meeting.

<Perhaps a paragraph about how much time we planned on spending vs how much we actually spent?>

\subsection{Original Plan}
From our Work Breakdown Structure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Enable display of available products (no GUI is to be implemented)
	\item Listing the next 5 available booking dates for a selected product
	\item Listing modules available for a selected product
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Revised Plan}
At the sprint plan meeting, we planned the following for this sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Stuff
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development}
The development started off with the creation of an ASP.NET MVC project. In this project we created data objects for the ad info described in the assignment.

\subsection{Other Work}
In addition to the development, we also completed a draft of the outline for this report and improved on our architectural documentation.

\subsection{Backlog}
<What we planned for the sprint that we either did not complete, get time to start, or that was simply pushed back>

\subsection{Retrospective}
While we had initially planned to complete some of the "easy" parts of the implementation during this sprint, this turned out to be a lot harder than expected. We only managed to get started before we ran into problems related to unfamiliarity with the technology.

We also spent less time both on development and on the project in general than we had originally planned, partly due to projects in other courses also taking up a lot of our time.

What we learned from this sprint was more about how much we would actually be able to do in a single sprint, and that we were still quite far away from being able to implement specific parts of the requirements.

%Argh, what happened to the line breaks and indentations?
