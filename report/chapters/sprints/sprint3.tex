\subsection{Development}
What we accomplished in development during the sprint.
We created the master controller which communicated with the database through the entity framework, it also took care of passing models to the view(s) and handle user request. This master controller was a MVC-type controller which is mostly used as a prototype and for us to test that the data we submit actually reach the system.

Other work we did during the sprint, such as producing documentation or attending courses.
After creating and finishing the master controller, the final architecture was made.
