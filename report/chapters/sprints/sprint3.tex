\section{Sprint 3}

\subsection{Time Frame}
The time frame for Sprint 3 was week 42 and 43. We started the sprint on October 14th with a weekly supervisor meeting, followed by a sprint plan meeting. We finished the sprint on October 25th with a sprint review meeting.

\subsection{Original Plan}
From our Work Breakdown Structure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Database communication interface
	\item Version control system
	\item Bugfixing
	\item Testing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Revised Plan}
At the sprint plan meeting, we planned the following for this sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Stuff
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development}
We created the master controller which communicated with the database through the entity framework, it also took care of passing models to the view(s) and handle user request. This master controller was a MVC-type controller which is mostly used as a prototype and for us to test that the data we submit actually reach the system.

\subsection{Other Work}
After creating and finishing the master controller, the final architecture was made.

The first Friday of this sprint we attended a technical writing course organized by the course staff, where we received pointers on writing our report. These included both general tips as well as concrete improvements for our report specifically.
