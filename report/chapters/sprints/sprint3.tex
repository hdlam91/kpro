\section{Sprint 3}

\subsection{Time Frame}
The time frame for Sprint 3 was week 42 and 43. We started the sprint on October 14th with a weekly supervisor meeting, followed by a sprint plan meeting. We finished the sprint on October 25th with a sprint review meeting.

\subsection{Original Plan}
From our Work Breakdown Structure:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Database communication interface
	\item Version control system
	\item Bugfixing
	\item Testing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Revised Plan}
At the sprint plan meeting, we planned the following for this sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Stuff
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development}
We created the master controller which communicated with the database through the entity framework, it also took care of passing models to the view(s) and handle user request. This master controller was a MVC-type controller which is mostly used as a prototype and for us to test that the data we submit actually reach the system.

\subsection{Other Work}
After creating and finishing the master controller, the final architecture was made.

The first Friday of this sprint we attended a technical writing course organized by the course staff, where we received pointers on writing our report. These included both general tips as well as concrete improvements for our report specifically.

\subsection{Backlog}
Originally we planned to finish the product in Sprint 3, however the we had a lot of issues/problems in both Sprint 1 and 2 so we couldn't start implementing code before Sprint 3. However when the problems were sorted out.
%What we planned for the sprint that we either did not complete, get time to start, or that was simply pushed back.

\subsection{Customer Meeting}
%<Add important notes from the customer meeting here, as well as new conclusions made>
We decided to not have a customer meeting for sprint 3 due to our customer Asle not being physically available. Asle was on a 3 weeks vacation in Spain for this period, and we didn't feel the necessity to go to the trouble of setting up a video conference.
However we felt that we had control of the implementation or knew how to fix the issues we stumbled upon.

\subsection{Retrospective}
How we feel about the sprint.
