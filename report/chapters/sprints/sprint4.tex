\section{Sprint 4}
\subsection{Time Frame}
When we didn't finish implementation by the end of Sprint 3, we had to add another sprint. The time frame for Sprint 4 was week 44 and 45. We started the sprint on October 28th with a weekly supervisor meeting, followed by a sprint plan meeting. We finished the sprint on November 8th.
\subsection{Original Plan}
Because we had planned to finish within three sprints, there were originally no plans for Sprint 4.
