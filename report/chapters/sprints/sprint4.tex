\section{Sprint 4}

\subsection{Time Frame}
When we didn't finish implementation by the end of Sprint 3, we had to add another sprint. The time frame for Sprint 4 was week 44 and 45. We started the sprint on October 28th with a weekly supervisor meeting, followed by a sprint plan meeting. We finished the sprint on November 8th.

\subsection{Original Plan}
Because we had planned to finish within three sprints, there were originally no plans for Sprint 4. However we quickly realized that we needed a Sprint 4 due to incomplete product at the end of Sprint 3.

\subsection{Revised Plan}
At the sprint plan meeting, we planned the following for this sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item None
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Development}
We converted the existing MVC controller of our implementation to a Web API controller.
We created a new architecture which corresponds to the actual implementation.

\subsection{Other Work}
<Other work we did during the sprint, such as producing documentation or attending courses.>

\subsection{Backlog}
We finished the implementation and had the acceptance customer meeting.
The most important thing to focus on after Sprint 4 is the report.


\subsection{Customer Meeting}
We had a customer meeting with the Asle on 6 November 2013 where we showed him the MVC controller we made - how it interacted with the database and how data was sent from one view to another. Due to the fact that Asle was still in Spain we had to do the customer meeting through Skype (video conferencing software).

\subsection{Retrospective}
How we feel about the sprint.
