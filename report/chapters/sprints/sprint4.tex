\chapter{Sprint 4}

\section{Time Frame}
When we didn't finish implementation by the end of Sprint 3, we had to add another sprint. The time frame for Sprint 4 was week 44 and 45. We started the sprint on October 28th with a weekly supervisor meeting, followed by a sprint plan meeting. We finished the sprint on November 8th.

\section{Original Plan}
Because we had planned to finish within three sprints, there were originally no plans for Sprint 4. However we quickly realized that we needed a Sprint 4 due to incomplete product at the end of Sprint 3.

\section{Revised Plan}
At the sprint plan meeting, we planned the following for this sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item None
\end{itemize}


\section{Development}
We converted the existing MVC controller of our implementation to a Web API controller, and fixed documentation
The architecture that were created in the beginning did not reflect the new changes we had made to the product due to Architectural erosion so they needed to be updated to better the reflect the actual system implemented.

\section{Other Work}
We made the final outline of the report, and discussed which sections (including sub - and subsub- sections) that we needed to include or rework before the final delivery.

The documentation needed to be completed along with the product, so we had to go through each method and write a XML Documentation Comments on each of them.

\section{Backlog}
We finished the implementation and had the acceptance customer meeting.
The most important thing to focus on after Sprint 4 is the report.


\section{Customer Meeting}
We had a customer meeting with the Asle on 6 November 2013 where we showed him the MVC controller we made - how it interacted with the database and how data was sent from one view to another. Due to the fact that Asle was still in Spain we had to do the customer meeting through Skype (video conferencing software).

\section{Retrospective}
We didn't like that we had to go to a Sprint 4 because we had hoped that we were done with the implementation on Sprint 3. The conversion of the MVC controller to the API controller yielded problems we didn't expect, it should have went more smoothly but due to big differences in both controllers we had to rewrite a lot of the code to convert it.
