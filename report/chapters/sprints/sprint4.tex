\section{Sprint 4}

\subsection{Time Frame}
When we didn't finish implementation by the end of Sprint 3, we had to add another sprint. The time frame for Sprint 4 was week 44 and 45. We started the sprint on October 28th with a weekly supervisor meeting, followed by a sprint plan meeting. We finished the sprint on November 8th.

\subsection{Original Plan}
Because we had planned to finish within three sprints, there were originally no plans for Sprint 4. However we quickly realized that we needed a Sprint 4 due to incomplete product at the end of Sprint 3.

\subsection{Revised Plan}
At the sprint plan meeting, we planned the following for this sprint:
\begin{itemize}
	\item None
\end{itemize}
However we decided that the Sprint 4 was a "finish/polishing the implementation of the product"-Sprint.

\subsection{Development}
We converted the existing MVC controller of our implementation to a Web API controller.
We created a new architecture which corresponds to the actual implementation.

\subsection{Other Work}
<Other work we did during the sprint, such as producing documentation or attending courses.>

\subsection{Backlog}
<What we planned for the sprint that we either did not complete, get time to start, or that was simply pushed back.>

\subsection{Customer Meeting}
<Add important notes from the customer meeting here, as well as new conclusions made>

\subsection{Retrospective}
How we feel about the sprint.
