\chapter*{Abstract}

This paper describes the process of developing a framework for Automatic Importing of Completed Ads, on request from Adresseavisen AS, which is a major regional newspaper. It will describe the project, from the preliminary study phase and project management/organization, to implementation and completion.

The goal is to create a framework which will facilitate automatic importing of completed real estate ads in the form of pdf-files and associated data, with possibility to expand to other types of ads. The accompanying data will be placed into the internal database of Adresseavisen and their internal order system for ads, and the pdf is to be saved in their archives.

Adresseavisen, as a customer, is interested in the framework in itself, with accompanying developer documentation for possible further development. In addition to this, we will produce full documentation of the process as a deliverable in the course which this project is for.
