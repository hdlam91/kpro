\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}

The project we were given did not contain any questions regarding thing to evaluate, so there are nothing to conclude in that respect. However, as a group we have come to several conclusions regarding the technology we used, and the project as a whole.

\section{Future Work}

In terms of future work, we as a group have several items we could suggest for a future improvement of the product, after we have completed our part with this report.

We did not have the time to implement accepting and adding pictures in the database. This will require a module with some integration into our current project, but should not be
hard to accomplish.

Secondly we have mostly relied on the integrated extensibility in Web API to provide the desired modularity and extensibility in the product. Any future additions of modules could be
added via modification of WebAPI settings, and using our completed work as templates, but there is room for improvement in this regard. It's possible to generalize our API more, for support
of other ad types, though it would require significant work or much more experience with Web API than our group have had. The required work would possibly involve generalized Controller templates
who can handle various types of input and operations, and in that regard are extensible to usable Controllers for ads. This would also probably require generalized model binders and data formatters, which require more understanding of Web API than we have been able to get; it should nonetheless be achievable as a project in its own sense.

The project could also have benefited from a more purpose-built database, and by extension: a more straigthforward way to communicate with data storage. However, this would perhaps not be feasible to follow through on, due to the current database serving other functions and possibly serving other systems as well.
