\section{Preliminary Studies}
\subsection{Development Methodology}
The customer driven project adopts two development technology, waterfall and scrum.
\subsubsection{Waterfall}
The waterfall development method is an sequential design process.
\subsubsection{Scrum}
Scrum is an agile method.
\subsubsection{What we have chosen}
\subsection{Frameworks}
\subsubsection{Software Development Model}
\subsubsection{Programming languages, Communication Protocols and File Formats}
\subsubsection{Web Api}
\subsubsection{Server}
\subsubsection{Database}
We had a lot of problems with the database, the customer said he'd put up a database server for us to use. However this turned out to be difficult to achieve due to the security/confidentiality issues on their server. We had to try to set up the database server ourself on our local machine, this proved to be rather difficult due to microsoft tools not giving enough information, and thereby not installing the necessary tools.     
The customer uses a MSSQL server and they provided an 11GiB .bak file which we could use to restore the database.
