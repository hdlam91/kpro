\section{Preliminary Studies}
This section contains the information we found in our preliminary studies, and the choices we made from the information we gathered. Covered here are process-related topics such as development methodology, pros and cons of these, and which we chose, as well as technology-related topics such as frameworks and standards.
\subsection{Development Methodology}
The customer driven project enforces two types of development methodologies, the sequential waterfall method, and the agile scrum.
\subsubsection{Waterfall}
The waterfall development method is a sequential design process. It is divided into clear phases, although there is often a little overlap between them. The first phases focus on gathering requirements and writing initial documentation like design/architecture. Later phases move on to actual implementation, then testing, followed by final report. Maintenance after a "completed" project might also be part of the process. <add figure depicting process>

\subsubsection{Scrum}
Scrum is an agile method.
\subsubsection{What we have chosen}
\subsection{Frameworks}
\subsubsection{Software Development Model}
\subsubsection{Programming languages, Communication Protocols and File Formats}
\subsubsection{Web Api}
\subsubsection{Server}
\subsubsection{Database}
We had a lot of problems with the database, the customer said he'd put up a database server for us to use. However this turned out to be difficult to achieve due to the security/confidentiality issues on their server. We had to try to set up the database server ourself on our local machine, this proved to be rather difficult due to microsoft tools not giving enough information, and thereby not installing the necessary tools.     
The customer uses a MSSQL server and they provided an 11GiB .bak file which we could use to restore the database.
