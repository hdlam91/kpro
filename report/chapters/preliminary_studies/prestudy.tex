\section{Preliminary Studies}
This section contains the information we found in our preliminary studies, and the choices we made from the information we gathered. Covered here are process-related topics such as development methodology, pros and cons of these, and which we chose, as well as technology-related topics such as frameworks and standards.
\subsection{Development Methodology}
The customer driven project enforces two types of development methodologies, the sequential waterfall method, and the agile scrum.
\subsubsection{Waterfall}
The waterfall development method is a sequential design process. It is divided into clear phases, although there is often a little overlap between them. The first phases focus on gathering requirements and writing initial documentation like design/architecture. Later phases move on to actual implementation, then testing, followed by final report. Maintenance after a "completed" project might also be part of the process. <add figure depicting process>
