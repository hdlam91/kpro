\section{Preliminary Studies}
This section contains the information we found in our preliminary studies, and the choices we made from the information we gathered. Covered here are process-related topics such as development methodology, pros and cons of these, and which we chose, as well as technology-related topics such as frameworks and standards.

\subsection{Frameworks}
\subsubsection{Software Development Model}
\subsubsection{Programming languages, Communication Protocols and File Formats}
\subsubsection{Web Api}
\subsubsection{Server}
To run the web api framework there's IIS express that comes with visual studio 2012. The express version is meant to be used for developing purposes, when deploying the product a full version of IIS should be used.
\subsubsection{Database}
We had a lot of problems with the database, the customer said he'd put up a database server for us to use. However this turned out to be difficult to achieve due to the security/confidentiality issues on their server. We had to try to set up the database server ourself on our local machine, this proved to be rather difficult due to microsoft tools not giving enough information, and thereby not installing the necessary tools. Some of us communicated via SMS and phone services.
The customer uses a MSSQL server and they provided an 11GiB .bak file which we could use to restore the database.
