\section{Web Application Implementations}

This section will contain information and reasoning about our use of two  of Mocrosofts
web application technologies: ASP.NET MVC, and ASP.NET Web API.

Our use of these technologies stems from requirements by the customer, who already uses Microsoft technology, and required that this project also made use of MS technology in order to fit into their systems. In particular this was to ease interaction with Entity Framework, which was another requirement for technology to be used in database communication.
