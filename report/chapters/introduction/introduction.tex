\subsection{Customer - Adresseavisen AS}

\subsection{Project Purpose}
The purpose of this project is to create a framework for automated import of complete ads in the form of pdf-files. The pdf-files will be accompanied by data, which shall be added to the database, and used to create an order in Adresseavisens internal order system for ads. This framework shall also be able to provide certain information that is to be given to customers when they wish to have an ad featured in Adresseavisen, such as available dates and ad-packages.


\subsection{Project background}
Adresseavisen currently uses a system where ads to be featured on website, or published in newspapers are created in the system, with the use of one of very many templates. This is very complex and an increasing amount of customers uses their own fully completed ads, in the form of pdf-files. 
Adresseavisen now has the need for a system which can automate and simplify the process of receiving these ads into the system, with the purpose of eventually replacing the old system.

\subsection{Problem Description}
Webassistenten will take a completed ad in the form of a pdf file and save it to the appropiate folder, these folder will have the correct ID of the customer so adressa can easily identify which pdf belongs to which customer.
Webassistenten will require certain data along with the pdf, ie. date, module etc. These data will be saved into a database internally in their system.

\subsection{Existing Technology}
<Already existing technology that the customer could have used rather than employing us to develop new software.>

\subsection{Measure of Project Effects}
We as a group will not see any difference if real estate companies uses this system, the end result of produced by or without our product will be the same. Hopefully the real estate companies will save time and the ad submitted is accepted in the format they want it to be.
