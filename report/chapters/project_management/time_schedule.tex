\subsection{Time schedule}
In this section follows the time planning and schedule, in the form of a Work Breakdown Stucture (WBS), and a Gantt diagram.
The Gantt diagram contains the implementation packages in the form of sprints, seeing as the project paln called for a agile-like organisation of the implementation phase, with multiple iterations on each implementation package, and the corresponding detailed architecture. More information on that can be found in the overall project plan chapter.
