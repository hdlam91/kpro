\section{Roles}
In the beginning of the project we defined the team roles as in the following table.

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{5cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Role} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Responsibility}\\
    \hline

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Overview of Roles and Responsibilities}
  \end{table}
  
As the project progressed, the actual roles we fell into changed. Our development methodology changed from the planned scrum to a more sequential method (see sections \ref{methodologyChoice} and \ref{methodInPractice} for more on this), and as a result roles such as the Scrum Master were dropped. A table of the new role division can be seen below.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Role} & \textbf{Responsibility}\\
\hline
Truls Hamborg & Documentation Manager & Ensures good design and structure in internal and external documentation.\\
\hline
Hong-Dang Lam & System Architect & Create and maintain the architectural documentation. Ensure implementation adheres to the documentation and prevent architectural drift/erosion.\\
 & Lead Coder & Main contributor of code to the implementation.\\
 & Customer and Supervisor Contact & Main point of contact between the group and the customer and supervisor.\\
