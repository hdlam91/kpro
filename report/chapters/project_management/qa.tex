\subsection{Procedures for Quality Assurance}
This section is about our routines to ensure the quality of the project - both including the product and its report. 

\subsubsection{Documentation and report}
All written material produced by the group should be proof read by at least one of the other group members. All meeting agendas and minutes will follow the template as shown in Appendix \ref{appendixTemplate} on page \pageref{appendixTemplate}


\subsubsection{Group dynamics}
Inside the group all the communication will be done in Norwegian. We have regularly working hours each weekday from 10:15 except Tuesdays. We start each working day with a status meeting. 
Communication is done by email and Facebook or sms. 

\subsubsection{Customer relations}
There will be meetings with the customer regularly to keep in contact and be sure that we don't miss important details about the product. All the communication with the customer will be done in Norwegian. 


\subsubsection{Advisor relations}
There will be meetings with the Advisor regularly. We started out weekly, but in the sprints we decided to have it between every sprints. Any information which the Advisor should comment on or read should be sendt to him 24 hours before the meeting. All contact with the Advisor will be done in English.
