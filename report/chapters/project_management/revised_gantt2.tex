\section{Work Breakdown Structure}
In this subsection you will find the main packages of our revised work breakdown structure.

\subsection{Estimation methods}

The method used to split work into packages, and estimate the total work hours of the packages was mostly one of cooperative iteration. Work was split into packages by consensus in a group discussion after analysis of the project, and then assigned work hours.

Hours were assigned by each member submitting a suggestion, and then the average of those values were selected, possibly after some discussion if the discrepancies were large. When all packages were assigned such values, they were compared to each other and adjusted if inconsistencies were found. Then, at the end, the total sum of all hours were compared to the expected total of hours. This process was then repeated a few times until a satisfactory result was achieved.

\subsection{Pre-Study}
This package contains sub-packages for most the basic work done in the preliminary studies phase, before the start of implementation. The total number of hours in this package is 174, or about 9 person days per person.
