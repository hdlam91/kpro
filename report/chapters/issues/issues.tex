\subsection{Issues}
C\# compiler was not found due to uninstall√¨ng of RC, this lead to the "add new" window not opening, and therefore not possible to add the entity framework.\\
This command in cmd fixed it:
\begin{verbatim}
gacutil /u Microsoft.VisualStudio.CSharp.Services.Language.Interop 
\end{verbatim}


Mac is not a windows.
