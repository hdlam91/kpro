\subsection{Issues}
The project didn't go as smoothly as we had hoped. The group agreed on pretty much everything, but the issues we had were mostly related to the software and tools not cooperating or working as we expected.

\subsubsection{C\# Compiler}
C\# compiler was not found due to uninstall√¨ng of RC, this lead to the "add new" window not opening, and therefore not possible to add the entity framework.\\
This command in cmd fixed it:
\begin{verbatim}
gacutil /u Microsoft.VisualStudio.CSharp.Services.Language.Interop 
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{GitHub DDoS}
On October 14, the day of the midterm delivery, GitHub experienced a DDoS attack. This resulted in some of the files we were working on for the report becoming locked mid-commit and mid-pull, and preventing us from performing a new git pull. This also prevented some of us from compiling, due to a previous commit containing errors having been pulled.

\subsubsection{Windows on Mac}
