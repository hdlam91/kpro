\subsection{Issues}
C# compiler was not found due to uninstall of RC, this lead to the "add new" window not opening, and therefore not possible to add the entity framework.
\begin{verbatim}
gacutil /u Microsoft.VisualStudio.CSharp.Services.Language.Interop 
\end{verbatim} this command in cmd fixed it.

Mac is not a windows.
