\chapter{Requirements}
This chapter presentes the requirements specifications of the project with function requirements, non-functional requirements as well as user stories. The goal with this chapter is to present the products functions and behavior. The contents of this chapter consists mainly of listed requirements and their categories, seeing as the customer provided a comprehensive and textual detailed description of requirements,
which was well supplemented with additional details in the first customer meeting.

There was not much need for discussion or evaluation of possible requirements due to this fact, so as was mentioned earlier: the following is mostly lists and classifications.
