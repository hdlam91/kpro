\subsection{Project Background}
Adresseavisen currently uses an ad system where ads to be featured on website, or published in newspapers, are created in the system, with the use of one of very many templates. This is very complex , and an increasing amount of customers uses their own fully completed ads, in the form of pdf-files. 

Adresseavisen now has the need for a system which can automate and simplify the process of receiving these ads into the system.
