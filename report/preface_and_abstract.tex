\section{Abstract}

This paper describes the process of developing a framework for Automatic Importing of Completed Ads on request from Adresseavisen AS, which is a major regional newspaper. It will describe the project, from pre-study phase and project management/organization, to implementation and completion.

The goal is to create a framework which will facilitate automatic importing of completed real estate ads in the form of pdf-files and associated data, into the Adresseavisen internal database and order system for ads.

Adresseavisen, as a customer, is interested in the framework in itself, with accompanying developer documentation for possible further development. In addition to this, we will produce full documentation of the process as a deliverable in the course which this project is for.
